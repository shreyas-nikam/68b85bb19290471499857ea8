# QuLab User Guide: Drafting AML Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with AI Assistance

This codelab will guide you through the QuLab application, designed to assist AML analysts in drafting Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) using AI. The application streamlines the process, emphasizes human review, ensures auditability, and provides compliance guardrails. You will learn how to leverage AI to generate first-draft SAR narratives, summarize transaction timelines, and suggest typologies, all while adhering to regulatory requirements.

## Introduction: The Power of AI in AML

Duration: 00:05

This application demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can augment the crucial work of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) analysts.  It focuses on automating the initial phases of Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) generation, traditionally intensive in manual data synthesis and narrative drafting. By using AI to assist with the drafting process, AML analysts can focus on critical thinking, analysis, and ensuring compliance.

This lab will guide you through using AI to generate a preliminary SAR narrative, adhering to regulatory guidance. You will also extract key information (the 5Ws), and understand the importance of the human-in-the-loop review, as well as ensure auditability and compliance.

## Step 1: Case Intake

Duration: 00:10

The "Case Intake" page is the starting point. Here, you will load the data related to a specific case you're investigating. This data typically includes customer information, transaction details, alerts generated by monitoring systems, and any notes taken by analysts.

1.  **Loading Data:** You have two options for loading data into the application:
    *   **Upload Case Bundle:**  You can upload a file (e.g., CSV, JSON) containing the case data.
    *   **Generate Synthetic Case Data:**  For demonstration purposes, you can generate synthetic data.  This option creates a sample dataset that you can use to explore the application's functionalities.
2.  **Quick Stats Display:**  Once the data is loaded, the application displays a summary of key performance indicators (KPIs), such as:
    *   Total number of transactions
    *   Total inflow and outflow amounts
    *   Average transaction amount
    *   Number of customers and branches involved
    *   The time window covered by the data.
3.  **Possible Typologies:** Based on the loaded data, the application suggests potential AML typologies that might be relevant to the case. These typologies are based on predefined rules and patterns. For example, "Large Value Transactions" might be suggested if there are transactions exceeding a certain threshold.
4.  **Extract 5Ws:** Click the "Extract 5Ws from Loaded Data" button to automatically extract the Who, What, When, Where, and Why from your data.

<aside class="positive">
Loading the case data is the foundation for the rest of the SAR drafting process. Take your time to explore the generated stats and possible typologies to get a good understanding of the case.
</aside>

## Step 2: Explore Data

Duration: 00:15

The "Explore Data" page provides interactive visualizations to help you analyze the transaction data in detail. This page allows you to identify suspicious patterns and trends that may not be immediately obvious from the raw data.

1.  **Data Filters:**  Use the various filters to narrow down the data and focus on specific areas of interest. You can filter by:
    *   **Date Range:**  Select a specific time period to analyze.
    *   **Amount Range:**  Focus on transactions within a particular amount range.
    *   **Channel:**  Filter transactions by the channel used (e.g., online, branch, ATM).
    *   **Branch:**  Focus on transactions originating from specific branches.
    *   **Counterparty:**  Analyze transactions involving specific counterparties.
2.  **Visualizations:**  The application provides several visualizations to help you explore the data:
    *   **Timeline of Activity:**  This visualization shows the transaction volume over time, allowing you to identify periods of increased or unusual activity.
    *   **Geo Map:** This map displays transaction activity by branch location, highlighting potential high-risk areas.
    *   **Counterparty Network Graph:** This graph visualizes the relationships between customers and counterparties, helping to identify potential hubs of activity and complex transaction patterns.
    *   **Heatmaps:** The heatmaps show transaction intensity by day of week and hour of day, and alert density over time.
3.  **Typology Cues Panel:**  Based on the filtered data, the application suggests potential AML typologies that might be relevant to the case.
4.  **Draft Facts Tray:** A section for adding key facts observed during data exploration. This allows you to start building a list of supporting evidence for your SAR narrative.

<aside class="negative">
The filters applied on this page only filter the views and data available on this page, and does not affect the data on any other page. Make sure to consider the filters when analysing the data.

## Step 3: Draft SAR

Duration: 00:08

The "Draft SAR" page leverages AI to generate a first draft of the Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) narrative. The AI model uses the loaded case data and the extracted 5Ws (Who, What, When, Where, and Why) to create a preliminary narrative.

1.  **Generate Draft Narrative:** Click the "Generate Draft Narrative" button to initiate the AI-powered draft generation.
2.  **AI-Generated SAR Narrative:** The generated narrative will be displayed in a text area.  This is a first draft and requires careful human review, editing, and validation.

<aside class="positive">
The 5Ws are crucial for the LLM to generate an effective narrative. Ensure they are extracted correctly in the Case Intake Page before generating a SAR.
</aside>

## Step 4: Review & Compare

Duration: 00:15

The "Review & Compare" page is where you, as the AML analyst, refine the AI-generated SAR narrative. You can edit the draft, ensure accuracy, add missing details, and compare your edits with the original AI draft to track changes.

1.  **Analyst Review and Edits:** Use the rich text editor to modify the AI-generated narrative.  Correct any errors, add relevant information, and ensure the narrative is clear, concise, and accurate.
2.  **Version Control and Audit Logging:**
    *   Click the "Save Analyst Edits" button to save your changes.
    *   The application tracks each edit and creates an audit trail, recording the timestamp, editor, content hash, and a snapshot of the narrative.
3.  **Diff Viewer:** The "Diff Viewer" displays the differences between the original AI draft and your edited version, highlighting additions, deletions, and modifications.
4. **Explainability Panel:** Although conceptual, this panel would ideally show connections between narrative sentences and supporting data.

## Step 5: Compliance Checklist & Sign-off

Duration: 00:10

The "Compliance Checklist & Sign-off" page helps ensure the drafted SAR narrative meets all regulatory compliance requirements.

1.  **Compliance Checklist Status:**
    *   Click the "Run Compliance Checks" button to validate the narrative against key compliance items.
    *   The checklist verifies the presence of the 5Ws, chronological order, clarity, conciseness, and avoidance of speculation.
2.  **Compliance Officer Sign-off:**
    *   Enter the Compliance Officer's name and click the "Sign-off SAR" button to formally approve the SAR.
    *   The application checks if all critical compliance items have passed before allowing the sign-off.

## Step 6: Export & Audit

Duration: 00:07

The "Export & Audit" page allows you to export the completed SAR narrative, supporting facts, the compliance checklist report, and a detailed audit trail.

1.  **Export Final SAR Package:**
    *   Click the "Download Final SAR Package (JSON)" button to download all the SAR data in a structured JSON format.
2.  **Audit Trail:**
    *   The audit trail provides a complete history of all actions and changes throughout the SAR drafting process.
    *   You can download the audit trail in CSV or JSON format.
3.  **Content Immutability Verification:**
    *   The final content hash provides an immutable record of the SAR narrative at the time of sign-off.
    *   This hash can be used to verify that the exported narrative matches the approved version.

<aside class="positive">
Saving all the SAR data for future reference is extremely important and valuable. Take special care to ensure that the download is not interrupted and the SAR data is safely stored.
