# Streamlit Data Analysis & Visualization App

## Project Title and Description

This Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and visualizing data.  It allows users to upload CSV files, perform basic data analysis operations (such as calculating summary statistics and identifying missing values), and create interactive visualizations to gain insights from their data. This project serves as a lab exercise showcasing the power and simplicity of Streamlit for building data-driven web applications.

## Features

*   **CSV File Upload:**  Users can upload their data in CSV format directly through the Streamlit interface.
*   **Data Preview:**  Displays a sample of the uploaded data in a tabular format for quick inspection.
*   **Summary Statistics:**  Calculates and displays key descriptive statistics for numerical columns (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc.).
*   **Missing Value Analysis:**  Identifies and reports the number of missing values in each column.
*   **Interactive Visualizations:**
    *   Scatter plots for visualizing relationships between two numerical variables.
    *   Histograms for understanding the distribution of single numerical variables.
    *   Bar charts for visualizing categorical data.
*   **Downloadable Results:** Allows users to download the processed data and generated visualizations.
*   **Column Selection:** Dynamically selects which columns to use for specific visualizations.
*   **Customizable Plot Parameters:**  Allows users to adjust plot titles, axis labels, and other parameters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python:**  Version 3.7 or higher is recommended.
*   **pip:**  Python package installer (usually comes with Python).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>  # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL
    cd streamlit_data_app
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, install the necessary packages individually (see Technology Stack below):

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py  # Assuming your Streamlit application file is named app.py
    ```

2.  **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  **Using the application:**

    *   **Upload Data:**  Click the "Browse files" button to upload a CSV file.
    *   **Explore Data:**  View the data preview, summary statistics, and missing value analysis.
    *   **Create Visualizations:**  Select the desired plot type and column(s) from the dropdown menus. Customize plot parameters as needed.
    *   **Download Results:**  Use the download buttons to save the processed data and visualizations.
