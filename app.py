st.title("QuLab: AML SAR Drafting Assistant")
st.divider()
st.markdown('''
In this lab, we explore an AI-driven approach to assist Anti-Money Laundering (AML) analysts in drafting Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). This application is designed to streamline the SAR workflow by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate first-draft narratives, summarize transaction timelines, and suggest typologies.

**Learning Goals:**

*   Assist AML analysts by generating **first-draft SAR narratives**, summarizing transaction timelines, and suggesting typologiesâ€”**always** with human review, auditability, and compliance guardrails.
*   See how a **direct LLM call** can automate first-draft SAR narratives while strictly following regulatory guidance, without relying on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
*   Learn to **extract key information** (the 5Ws: Who, What, When, Where, Why) from case data, which is crucial for steering the LLM in generating a focused and compliant narrative.
*   Practice **human-in-the-loop** review and perform compliance checks on the generated narrative before its final export, ensuring accuracy and regulatory adherence.

### About / Controls

This panel provides an overview of key regulatory and operational considerations for SAR drafting and AI assurance.

*   **BSA/FinCEN SAR Requirements:** The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires financial institutions to report suspicious transactions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). SARs are critical tools in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.
*   **FinCEN Narrative Guidance:** FinCEN provides specific guidance on writing SAR narratives, emphasizing clarity, conciseness, chronology, and factual accuracy. Narratives should answer the 5Ws (Who, What, When, Where, Why) without speculation.
*   **OCC/SR 11-7 Model Risk Management:** The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve (SR 11-7) provide guidance on model risk management, which is highly relevant when deploying AI models in critical functions like SAR drafting. This includes model validation, governance, and ongoing monitoring.
*   **MITRE AI Assurance Cues:** The MITRE ATLAS framework offers a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques for AI systems, helping to identify and mitigate risks associated with AI deployment, including fairness, transparency, and robustness.
